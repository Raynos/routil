# routil

Gently manipulate req and res

## Motivation

The notion behind the routil concept is that you don't need a web framework when you can use a union of small libraries

## Small libraries

 - [redirecter][1]
 - [data-send][4]
 - [media-types][5]
 - [content-types][6]
 - [mapleTree][7]
 - [routes][2]
 - [st][3]
 - [templar][8]
 - [error-page][9]
 - More to come!
